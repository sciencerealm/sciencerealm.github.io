                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is the Galaxy?</h2>
                        <p>A galaxy is an incredibly large system of celestial bodies and matter bound together by gravity. Our Solar System is also located in a large galaxy called the Milky Way, where millions upon millions of objects including stars, stellar remnants, cosmic dust and gravitationally interacting dark matter. guide each other and revolve around an incredibly massive black hole at the center of this galaxy.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/img post/5_1.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">“Is it not careless to become too local when there are four hundred billion stars in our galaxy alone.”</span>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Trees and life</h2>
                        <p>Although it is so huge, the number of stars still cannot compare with the number of 3.04 trillion ( 3.04 x 10^12 ) trees on earth, the "green lung" of the mother earth in general has a size extremely large on our scale. It is a very good thing for not only humans but also for countless other living creatures living on this planet.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/img post/5_2.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">“Trees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth.”</span>
                        <p>Based on the calculated data, an average adult sycamore tree (a tree variety grown in North America) produces about 15.83 kg of oxygen per year and the amount of oxygen that humans need to survive. respiration during the same period is about 2,185 tons of oxygen. So for each person who hits me to be able to breathe normally every year, 138 trees need to exist in parallel, a total of 7.3 billion people today to breathe normally each year, more than a thousand trees are needed. billion (10^12) trees coexist.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Human</h2>
                        <p>That is a rather small number compared to more than 3 trillion trees that exist on earth today, so that is probably also the reason why we humans are indifferent to nature, to the "lungs" itself. ours come like this. Every year the earth loses about 7.3 million hectares of forest, about the size of the whole country of Panama.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/img post/5_3.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">“To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity.”</span>
                        <p>Along with that is a heavy impact on the earth's ecology, statistics in the past 40 years show that the number of wild animals has decreased by 58% due to human activities, most of which are caused by deforestation. Deforestation robs and affects the habitat of thousands of creatures.</p>
                        <p>And you've probably heard the phrase "protective forest", the forest has always been a shield to protect us from countless natural disasters and floods. In Vietnam alone, each year floods and landslides cause more than 100 tragic deaths and hundreds of millions of dollars in loss. If the situation of forest area continues to disappear like this, the numbers above will also never stop.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Meaning of green tree</h2>
                        <p>From time immemorial, trees have always been a symbol of life. They have been attached to life since before we humans existed long ago and will certainly forever be associated with life until there is no more life for them to protect and nurture. So it is no exaggeration to say that planting and protecting trees is the best thing we can do for the motherland, to forever keep the name "Blue Planet" in the solar system or maybe this whole Milky Way.</p>
