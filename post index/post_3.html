                        <p>A phenomenon that occurs in the nuclei of unstable atoms (radioactive isotopes), they have an excess of energy, so they tend to release that energy to the outside to get a more stable state. stable isotope). The released energy is beams of particles traveling at great speeds equal to the speed of light called nuclear radiation with the ability to ionize other atoms by separating electrons from atoms.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/img post/3_1.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">“Here they go cruising for a fortnight up in parts where everyone is dead of radiation, and all that they can catch is measles!”</span>
                        <p>If the radiation intensity is large enough, these beams of particles are extremely dangerous, we can think of them as bullets at the atomic level that cause damage to the body at the microscopic level, after which the radiation will start. First ionizes molecules in the body and separates them into free radicals with strong activity (which are oxidants such as superoxide, ozone, hydrogen peroxide). These free radicals will directly participate in the vital activities of the body, creating bonds with molecules such as DNA, proteins, fats, etc., causing difficulties in the metabolism of cells and over time. The cells will die slowly. The DNA will be killed or damaged in large quantities, making the body's ability to repair its own DNA almost impotent, even at this time the natural repair process fails, leading to the formation of cancer cells. letters. Depending on different levels, the human body will also be affected differently depending on the level of harm as well as the exposure time and intensity of radiation.</p>
                        <p>There are many units of measurement of reflected intensity to serve many different research purposes. Here I want to use the Sievert (Sv) as the unit of measurement for the absorption of ionizing radiation with damaging effects. No matter where we run in the world, we can't avoid radiation because basically everything is radioactive even ourselves, radiation levels are generally stable on earth ( background radiation ) fluctuates between 0.15 and 0.2 mSv/h ( micro Sieverts per hour ) and if you are exposed to radiation concentrations of 2 Sv (2000 mSv ) or more at the same time you will die later that's just a little while.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The dangers of bananas?</h2>
                        <p>Yes, everything in this world is an emitter, but it depends on the composition of that thing. As we all know, radioactivity occurs in unstable atomic isotopes, each chemical element has a different radioactivity, but the element with the strongest radioactivity known to man is Uranium (U), followed by Polonium (Po).</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/img post/3_2.webp" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">“Bananas are not only incredibly healthy but also one of the most convenient snack foods around.”</span>
                        <p>And banana is a fruit that contains a lot of potassium (K) along with its unstable isotopes (K40). In fact, bananas are not dangerous to us at all because the radiation concentration of bananas is only 0.1 mSv/h, even lower than the Earth's background radiation, they are only higher than other fruits. The tree is a little different, so you can rest assured to enjoy those bananas without having to worry about anything. Except that you want to eat 20,000 bananas at a time which I believe can kill you 100% with radiation.</p>
                        <p>Bananas may be harmless, but another everyday thing that exposes you to enormous amounts of radiation that we often don't even notice is smoking. In tobacco ingredients there is Polonium 210, the element I mentioned above, a strong radioactive isotope and that is also the main cause of lung cancer in cigarettes. For you to easily imagine, the average healthy person is exposed to about 1500 mSv a year, and the average smoker's lungs will be exposed to 160,000 more mSv per year, not to mention the harmful substances in tobacco. Therefore, tobacco is death and bananas are just a delicious and cheap fruit for the whole world.</p>
