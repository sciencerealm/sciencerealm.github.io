                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is plasma?</h2>
                        <p>Almost all matter has four states of existence that are solid, liquid, gas and plasma, we usually only see three states as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When the condensed matter is in the solid state, then the molecules that make up the object have a certain order, lie close to each other and have the property of resisting shape change, so they have a certain shape.</li>
                            <li>When we heat an object to its melting point, the object will begin to melt and exist in a liquid state, then the molecules lose their order but are still bound together, the shape of matter at that time. This depends on its container.</li>
                            <li>Increasing the temperature to the temperature of evaporation, the molecules separate and move chaotically, at this time the bonds between the molecules are very weak, they are evenly distributed inside the container.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/img post/4_1.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">“Concentrated serum albumin fractionated from blood plasma was effective in battlefield treatment of shock.”</span>
                        <p>And the plasma state that I want to direct people to is the state that needs to provide the most heat of matter. When the object is in the gaseous state, we continue to add a large temperature until the ionization processes occur, the negatively charged electrons in the atom will split and leave behind the positively charged nuclei and they turbulent flight to form a mixture capable of ionizing the surrounding space.</p>
                        <p>But the way to make plasma is not so difficult that you have to heat everything to extremely high temperatures, we can use an electric source with a voltage so high that electrons in gas atoms are ripped out. around and form the mixture as we know above. This method is often used very commonly in engineering industries, creating extremely hot heat flows to cut metal without creating harmful gases.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Freezing Fire</h2>
                        <p>So what is the freezing fire that I am talking about here? How a fire can cool and freeze things instead of heating as we usually see. Here are two videos of a very famous youtube channel about science, The Action Lab did an experiment on this phenomenon, which I will leave the link below so you can clearly see this scientific phenomenon.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/img post/4_2.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">“Ice burns, and it is hard to the warm-skinned to distinguish one sensation, fire, from the other, frost.”</span>
                        <p>Basically, this is just the process of creating plasma with a normal high-potential electrode and along with it losing its heat quickly by changing the ionized gas, specifically at This is Helium (He). I will explain in detail the experiment as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first device that the video uses is an electrode tip with an extremely large potential (10,000 volts) wrapped in a glass tube that directs the gas and absorbs some of the heat of the process.</li>
                            <li>We have a plastic tube that conducts Helium gas directly through the electrode tip, Helium is a substance that is easily ionized and also has an extremely large heat exchange capacity with an inexpensive price.</li>
                            <li>When the process goes on, we see that the ionization process continuously occurs creating a light blue light like a flame, although this nature generates a huge amount of heat, it does not cause damage to the objects we live in. we let in contact even with our own body. Because electrons have a temperature of more than 10,000 degrees Celsius, but because of their extremely small mass, by the time they reach our hands, they have exchanged all that little heat with the surrounding cold air, so we are not affected by any large temperature effects.</li>
                            <li>And in this process we can easily lower the temperature of this flame even further, and even freeze things by lowering the temperature of the specific ionized gas that is Helium.</li>
                        </ul>
