                        <p>Is it possible that our Earth is losing its inherent green color as each day passes, the pollution in many parts of the world is increasing and multiplying? And are we seriously questioning the future of life on Earth?</p>
                        <p>If you are really a person who takes today's environmental issues seriously, I hope this article will help reinforce that point of view, and if you still haven't seen the seriousness of this problem, I hope that The information below will help you somewhat imagine the most worrying situation of all living things on this planet.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Environment</h2>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/img post/1_1.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">“One of the first conditions of happiness is that the link between man and nature shall not be broken.”</span>
                        <p>Basically, the environment is everything around us such as trees, soil, water, wind, etc. Everything in nature contributes to the environment we live in. Can you imagine a life without these elements? It is the solid ground that gives us the opportunity to build homes, it is the fertility of the soil that helps plants grow to provide an infinite source of oxygen that enables us to carry out life activities, and without water, we humans won't be able to live more than 2 weeks. And the countless things that nature is always there to make us possible, so if everyone is grateful for being alive, that gratitude must be for nature and the environment.</p>
                        <p>Because we and all other living creatures are surrounded and live in such an "environment", if that environment is adversely affected, we will also have to bear all the consequences. Nature always balances itself, if everything is fully functioning according to nature, it will still completely arrange itself in peace, only human activities can have a strong negative impact on the environment. nature leads to the habitat of many species of organisms, including humans, is gradually degraded seriously.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">People and Consequences</h2>
                        <p>As a species living on Earth, we humans have the cover of nature and the environment to magically develop. If I could time travel just 200 years, which is a small amount compared to the history of human civilization development to the past, everything I told about household appliances or computers, phones, etc. would all be just These are magical things that most people wouldn't believe in. And certainly at the present time, after 100 years, we will not be able to imagine how far this human civilization will go and believe me, what you think is a fantasy or not. maybe tomorrow it could be something all too ordinary for some of us in the future. Unless people put an end to themselves by destroying their own living environment.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">“The environment is where we all meet; where we all have a mutual interest.”</span>
                        <p>The burning problem that people always worry about is waste, every day, the whole world discharges more than 3.5 million tons of waste into the environment, including plastic, aluminum, glass and countless other wastes. other types of garbage that take tens, hundreds or even thousands of years for them to decompose in the environment. And according to the United Nations, 90.5% of plastic globally will never be recycled. Thus, at least more than hundreds of millions of tons of plastic will live a lifetime with our great grandchildren.</p>
