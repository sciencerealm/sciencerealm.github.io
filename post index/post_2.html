                        <p>Biologically, we humans are mammals and at the top of the food chain, so we have the right and the ability to consume the lower animals, and In fact, we've been doing it very well. Almost anywhere in the world has its own "specialties" made from all kinds of animals in this world. So with the population increasing, the demand for food is also increasing, should we think about the opposite direction, which is how many animals die every day so that we can have delicious meals? no? So let's try to think about the problem in that direction with the information and data in this article. First, let's take a look at some of the darkest human milestones.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Bloody History</h2>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/img post/2_1.png" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">“Our dead are never dead to us, until we have forgotten them.”</span>
                        <p>According to the US Census Bureau, it was estimated in 2015 that the number of people born in the world throughout human history totaled 108.2 billion. This is an extremely large number compared to the current human population of 7.7 billion or more than 14 times.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the cause of death from old age and disease, the thing that causes the most deaths is the pandemic that we can typically talk about is the plague, also known as the "Death of the Dead". black" raged in many parts of the world, most strongly in Europe in the 14th century and caused the deaths of nearly 100 million people.</p>
                        <p>And if to talk about the cause of death, it is impossible to mention the war and especially the two world wars in the last century. If in the first world war the loss of life was 10 million people died within 4 years (1914-1918), in the 2nd all-out war, more than 70 million human lives were claimed within 6 years. (1939-1945).</p>
                        <p>Those are some remarkable historical milestones that have caused enormous damage to humanity, the numbers above are immense on our human scale. And the following will also be the statistics of the "damage" to the animals.</p>                 
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Animal perspective</h2>
                        <p>According to the "Sentientmedia" site, we get the following numbers of animals killed for food:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Every day, more than 150 million land animals are killed for meat, equivalent to about 56 billion lives per year, including chickens, ducks, cows, pigs, rabbits...</li>
                            <li>If you include the fishing and harvesting of fish in lakes and ponds, the number will reach 3 billion lives per day, which means more than a trillion or 1012 animals must die a year to serve food. our drink.</li>
                            <li>And what's worse when it comes to the fishing industry is that we very often pick up countless other innocent animals that when returned to the sea may have or will soon die. On average in the US, each person only consumes about 300 marine creatures per year, but in reality we have to kill up to 500 creatures to meet that need.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/img post/2_2.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">“Animals are such agreeable friends—they ask no questions; they pass no criticisms.”</span>
                        <p>And those are the general statistics about the situation of living species that are said to exist for human consumption. According to the science page Space, we humans predict that there are between 100 billion and 200 billion galaxies in the universe we see today, and if compared with the number of more than a trillion above, the number of animals we We consume in just one year 10 to 20 times the total number of galaxies in the entire universe. For myself, when reading about the deadly historical events of mankind, I can't help but feel sad when the number of casualties reaches tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of people, but when looking at the trillions of billions in Only then did I know how lucky I am to be born as a species at the top of the food chain.</p>
                        <p>Currently science is continuing to develop in all fields and including Biology, and as far as I know, there is some information about creating artificial proteins. If that work succeeds with great applicability, it may partly reduce the suffering of lower animals on this Earth, and maybe we will create a world where where all living things have the right to live and develop naturally instead of being forced to be food for higher species. See everyone on a topic not far away to talk more about this issue.</p>
